        Originally constructed in 1939, the facility has since played host to thousands of events, including the annual Grady County Fair and the Spring Junior Livestock Show, as well as concerts, bull buckouts, roping events, cutting horse and team penning events, numerous local and statewide educational events, sports activities, and the largest antique car swap meet in the nation.

        In 1999, voters of Grady County passed the initiation of a county-wide sales tax to provide funds for a complete renovation of the fairground facilities. Realizing the economic impact an updated facility could potentially generate, developers and planners worked to design an impressive center which would accommodate a host of events. Both indoor and outdoor arenas, plus two separate buildings available for a variety of uses, make the Grady County Fairgrounds and Events Center an ideal choice for your next event. Located just two minutes west of Interstate 44, Chickasha exit 83, the fairgrounds has great accessibility. The central location puts it within minutes of Oklahoma City, Lawton, Purcell and other Oklahoma towns. Travel time from Tulsa is approximately 2-1/2 hours, from Wichita Falls, Texas, 1-1/2 hours, and from the Dallas/Fort Worth area, 3 hours.

        Chickasha boasts a population of approximately 16,000 and is an agricultural-oriented community. Recent years have brought national attention to Chickasha due to the annual Festival of Light, an exquisite display of lights held nightly beginning one month before Christmas and continuing through New Years Eve. This event alone attracts over 300,000 people from across the nation. Other community activities include the annual Fourth of July celebration held at Shannon Springs Park.
                Chickasha offers a number of area motels, fast food and dine in eating establishments, feed and tack supplies, a public golf course, video and photography services, and all the other amenities you would expect. It has been known in livestock circles as "the trailer capitol of the world" for many years.
